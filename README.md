# Motivational-Quote-Scraper
First attempt at making a webscraper to pull motivational quotes from a website and display them, along with their authors.

There are two scripts: "Pull all quotes and authors" and "motvational quote textbox". The former pulls all the available quotes for the day and outputs them in the terminal, wheras the latter pulls a random quote and author and will display it in a tkinter gui message box.
